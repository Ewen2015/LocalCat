**LocalCat** is designed to make the LLM strategy easy to implement. It provides a simple API and an intuitive interface for loading, fine-tuning, and deploying large deep learning models. With LocalCat, you can easily fine-tune pre-trained models on your own data and leverage their power for your specific tasks.

## Tasks
### Translation
LocalCat offers user-friendly tools for translation tasks, allowing the translator to be deployed as an endpoint or for batch processing of `pandas` dataframes. Additionally, it provides fine-tuning capabilities for cloud deployment. 

1. Load pre-trained LLMs locally or from HuggingFace
2. Fine-tune the LLMs
3. Deployment as an endpoint on AWS

### Chat
(On the way. Stay tuned.)

## Install
```python
pip install localcat
```

## Story behind LocalCat

The package is named after a cat named Hulu, owned by my friend Flora.
